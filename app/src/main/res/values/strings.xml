        Memory was created as a group project as part of the course Application Development for Android (DA401E) at Malmo University.\n
        \n
        The gameplay of Memory is similar to the regular game, the player has to find a matching pair of cards in a grid of hidden cards. Normally, a matching pair of cards have identical images - but in our case the player is looking for matching styles on the images. This increases the difficulty significantly and even experienced players will find it challenging.\n
        \n
        If the game feels too easy you can increase the difficulty of the game to Intermediate or even Hard if you really want to challenge yourself.\n
        \n
        Once you have mastered the way of the Memory - why don’t you invite a friend to play with you? Compete to find the most pairs using devious tactics and mind boggling strategy.\n

        We developed Memory using:\n
        - Jetpack Compose for our user interface\n
        - Room to store the scores of the player\n
        - Coil to fetch resources from the API\n
        - Hilt to simplify dependency injection\n
        \n
        We hope you enjoy our game!\n
